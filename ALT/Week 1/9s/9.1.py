# Example code 2
def maths1():
  num1 = 50
  num2 = 5
  return num1 + num2
# provides two numbers and will display the sum when called upon
def maths2():
  num1 = 50
  num2 = 5
  return num1 - num2
# provides 2 numbers and will display the difference
def maths3():
  num1 = 50
  num2 = 5
  return num1 * num2
# provides 2 numbers and will display the product
outputNum = maths2()
print(outputNum)
# variable is called and will display the answer to the subtraction problem
# Example Code 3
def location(country):
  print("I am from " + country)
#subroutine is made

location("Brazil")
# subroutine is called and will display the message "I am from Brazil"
