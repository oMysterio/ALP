#Predict and Run Example 1
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does

firstName = "Andy"

print(firstName)

#Predict and Run Example 2
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does
# the output will display the text: Andy as it's displaying firstName and the firstName is equal to Andy meaning Andy is the first name.
lastName = "Colley"

fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

print(fullName)

#Predict and Run Example 3
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does
# the output will display Andy Colley as the full name. We've already put the variable that Andy was the first name, so another variable was added, the last name, Colley. Becuase of that, we can combine the 2 variables into 1 variable that being the full name
print("Hello " + firstName + ". Your full name is " + fullName + ".")
